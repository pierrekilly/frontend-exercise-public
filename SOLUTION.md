# Solution Docs

<!-- You can include documentation, additional setup instructions, notes etc. here -->
#### Comments:
* All requirements should be met. Had to refactor the data retrieval considerably towards the end in order not to violate the `The component should accept any HTTP endpoint` requirement (see commit comment).
* If I had more time I would've made the arrow key events much more cleaner. I am aware it's crap, but I wanted to get it working to move on. I decided not to use jQuery and that definitely slowed things down a bit.

#### Issues:
* GitHub API has rate-limiting, so users will likely block themselves accidentally doing this exercise from time to time.
